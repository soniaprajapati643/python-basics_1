        "*Python is a programming language that is easy to understand and write, making it a popular choice among developers and programmers.\n",
        "It is popular because it makes life easier for programmers and allow them to build effective applications for users and business.\n",

        "*Interpreter is a program that directly executes python code into machine code.\n",
        "\n",

        "-Keywords define the language's syntax rules and structure and they cannot be used as variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "-No, keywords can not be used as variable names.\n",

        "-In python, mutability whose state or value can be changed after they are created.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "-Lists use square brackets[]and it can modified easily but Tuples use Parentheses() instead of square bracket and the item in tuple cannot be modified.We can say that lists are mutable and tuples are immutable.\n",

        " This operator \"is\" compares the identity of two objects. It determines whether two variables or references  point to the exact same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",

        "-Logical operators in python are used to combine conditional statement and evaluate expressions based on their truth values (True and False).\n",

        "9.What is type casting in python?\n",
        "-Type casting(type conversion) is the process of changing one data type to another.\n",

        " *Explicit Type Casting (Type Conversion)\n",
